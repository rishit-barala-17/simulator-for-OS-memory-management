CACHE SIMULATOR – TEST RESULTS

Test Description:
This test validates multilevel cache behavior by simulating memory accesses under FIFO, LRU, and LFU replacement policies, ensuring correct hit/miss tracking and proper propagation of misses across cache levels.



==============================
Testing Policy: FIFO
==============================
Cache miss at all levels -> data fetched from main memory
Cache miss at all levels -> data fetched from main memory

Conclusion:
Cache hits and misses are correctly identified at each cache level.
Replacement policies behave according to their defined algorithms.
Cache statistics accurately represent access behavior and cache performance.

VIRTUAL MEMORY SIMULATOR – TEST RESULTS

Test Description:
This test validates virtual-to-physical address translation using paging by verifying page table lookups, page fault handling, frame allocation, and correct tracking of page hits and page faults using fixed virtual address accesses.



--- Sequential accesses (hits + faults) ---
Page fault occurred | Page 0 mapped to physical address 10
Page fault occurred | Page 1 mapped to physical address 120
Page fault occurred | Page 2 mapped to physical address 250
Access successful | Physical address = 30
Access successful | Physical address = 180

--- FIFO eviction check ---
Page fault occurred | Evicting page 0 | Page 3 mapped to physical address 50
Access successful | Physical address = 120
Page fault occurred | Evicting page 1 | Page 0 mapped to physical address 110

--- Invalid address test ---
Virtual address error: page index invalid
Access successful | Physical address = 95

--- Edge case validation ---
Page fault occurred | Evicting page 2 | Page 1 mapped to physical address 200
Page fault occurred | Evicting page 3 | Page 7 mapped to physical address 99
Access successful | Physical address = 201
Access successful | Physical address = 202

--- Eviction stress test ---
Page fault occurred | Evicting page 0 | Page 4 mapped to physical address 100
Page fault occurred | Evicting page 1 | Page 5 mapped to physical address 200
Page fault occurred | Evicting page 7 | Page 6 mapped to physical address 0

--- translate() API test ---
translate(250) -> 150 | fault=1
translate(450) -> 250 | fault=1
translate(120) -> 20 | fault=1

--- Final statistics ---

=== VM Report ===
Memory accesses: 20
Faulted pages: 13
Fault ratio: 65 %



Conclusion:
Virtual addresses are correctly translated into physical addresses.
Page faults are accurately detected and handled.
Page hit and fault statistics correctly reflect memory access behavior.
